Initially please make sure the problem hasn't been already addressed:
  * [ ] Are you using the latest driver?
    (https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu)
  * [ ] Are you using the latest EVDI version?
    (https://github.com/DisplayLink/evdi/releases)
  * [ ] If you are using a DisplayLink device, have you checked 'troubleshooting'
    on DisplayLink's website?
    (https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/topics/103927-troubleshooting-ubuntu)
  * [ ] Is this issue related to evdi/kernel?
    (if it is rather connected to DisplayLinkManager please take a look at support
    https://support.displaylink.com or forum https://www.displaylink.org/forum/)

Some information for baseline would help a lot:
  * Linux distribution and its version
  * Linux kernel version
  * Xorg version (if used)
  * Desktop environment in use

Please provide good title for the issue and description.
If you can give us logs they will be welcome but please don't paste long listings
as they will make it hard to read the thread, instead you can use other services
for sharing raw text like pastebin or gist.
Also anything that may help to understand the problem will be appreciated
(configuration files, screenshots, photos, video capturing the problem).

Thanks!
